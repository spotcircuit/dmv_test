    "A driver\u2019s license allows you to operate any vehicle or small truck less than 26,001 pounds that is exempt from commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL) requirements. Virginians have the option to obtain a REAL ID compliant driver\u2019s license. May 3, 2023, the federal government will require a REAL ID compliant credential (or another form of approved identification) to board a domestic flight or to access secure federal facilities. REAL ID compliant credentials display a small star in the upper right corner to indicate they meet federal requirements. For more information about obtaining a driver\u2019s license, refer to the publication Obtaining a Virginia Driver\u2019s License or Identification Card (DMV 141) available at www.dmvNOW.com or DMV customer service centers.",
    "A commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL) allows you to operate tractor-trailers, passenger buses, tank vehicles, school buses for 15 or more occupants (including the driver), or vehicles carrying hazardous materials. For more information about obtaining a CDL, refer to the Virginia Commercial Driver\u2019s Manual (DMV 60a and DMV 60v).",
    "If you wish to operate a school bus designed to carry 15 occupants (including the driver), you do not need to obtain  a commercial driver\u2019s license. However, you will need to take the commercial driver and school bus tests to obtain the school bus endorsement on your driver\u2019s license. You will  be restricted to driving a bus designed to carry 15 occupants (including the driver). This restriction will be printed on your license. For information about licensing requirements to operate larger school buses, refer to the Virginia Commercial Driver\u2019s Manual (DMV 60a).",
    "A motorcycle learner\u2019s permit allows you to operate a motorcycle after 4 a.m. and before midnight. You may operate the motorcycle only when supervised by a person who is at least 21 years of age, licensed to operate a motorcycle, and able to assist you while they are supervising from another motorcycle or other vehicle riding along with you. No one, other than the operator, can be on the motorcycle. You must always wear an approved helmet while operating a motorcycle in Virginia. For more information, refer to the Virginia Motorcycle Operator Manual (DMV 2).",
    "If you wish to operate a motorcycle in Virginia, you must pass the driver\u2019s license two-part knowledge exam, the motorcycle knowledge exam and the motorcycle road skills test. If you already hold a driver\u2019s license, you may add a Class M to your license. If you do not hold a driver\u2019s license, you may obtain a driver\u2019s license restricted to a Class M that only allows you to operate a motorcycle. For more information, refer to the Virginia Motorcycle Operator Manual (DMV 2).",
    "An international driver\u2019s license is not a valid driver\u2019s license and does not allow you to drive. It is only a foreign translation of your existing valid driver\u2019s license to be used when you are traveling outside of the United States. These permits are issued by your local AAA, except to persons whose driving privilege is suspended or revoked. If you are visiting the United States from a foreign country, you may drive using your driver\u2019s license issued by your home country. Your home country driver\u2019s license should be accompanied by a translation of the license. International driver\u2019s licenses marketed by private sector businesses are not valid and do not allow you to legally operate a motor vehicle. Sale of any document claiming to be a driver\u2019s license is a Class 1 misdemeanor."
