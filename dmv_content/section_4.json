    "Under Virginia law, the driver and all front seat passengers must wear safety belts. A driver transporting anyone younger than age 18 must ensure that the passenger is properly secured in a safety belt, booster seat or child safety seat no matter where the child is seated in the vehicle.",
    "Remember to wear your lap belt low on your lap and against your thighs. Wear your shoulder belt over your shoulder and across your chest. Never wear your shoulder belt behind your back or under your arm. Your shoulder and lap belts should be snug. Pregnant women are much safer if buckled up by wearing the belt as low on the pelvis as possible.",
    "Exception: A waiver of the seat belt requirement may be granted by a licensed physician if the use of a safety belt is not reasonable due to the driver's or passenger's physical or medical condition. The person granted the waiver must carry the physician's signed written statement identifying the person with the waiver and the reason for the waiver.",

Children should ride rear facing from birth to 2 years, or as long as the safety seat manufacturer allows. If the vehicle does not have a back seat, a rear facing child seat may be placed in the front passenger seat only if the vehicle is not equipped with a passenger side airbag or the passenger air bag is turned off. Children should ride facing forward in a child safety seat or booster seat until at least age 8, or until they can attain a proper seat belt fit.",
    "Criteria for sitting without a booster seat:",
    "A waiver of the child restraint law may be granted by a licensed physician if using a child restraint would be unreasonable due to the child's weight, physical fitness or other medical reasons. The person responsible for transporting this child must carry the signed written statement by the physician identifying the child and stating the grounds for the waiver.",
    "The driver is responsible for making sure that children are properly secured. If you are convicted of violating the child restraint law, you will be fined $50. A second or subsequent offense could mean a $500 penalty.",
