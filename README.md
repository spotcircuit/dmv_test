- Rules of the Road: 9 questions (25%)
- Safe Driving: 7 questions (20%)
- Penalties and Insurance: 5 questions (15%)
- Alcohol and Drugs: 5 questions (15%)

### Question Format
Questions are stored in `new_questions.json` with the following structure:
```json
{
    "category": "Road Signs",
    "question": "What does a red octagonal sign indicate?",
    "options": [
        "A. Yield",
        "B. Stop",
        "C. Do not enter",
        "D. No parking"

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Engaging feedback message..."
}
```

### Session Management
